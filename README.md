# Pathogenic Variant Finder

A high-performance Rust tool to identify pathogenic variants from VCF files using ClinVar and 1000 Genomes data.

## Overview

This tool analyzes VCF (Variant Call Format) files to identify potentially pathogenic genetic variants by cross-referencing them with the official ClinVar database and incorporating population frequency data from the 1000 Genomes Project. It supports both GRCh37 (hg19) and GRCh38 (hg38) genome builds.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Pathogenic Variant Detection**: Identifies variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar
- **Population Frequency Integration**: Incorporates allele frequencies from 1000 Genomes (global and by population)
- **High Performance**:
  - Parallel processing using Rayon's work-stealing thread pool
  - Efficient file handling with memory-mapped files
  - Parallel chunk downloads for reference databases
- **Rich Annotation**: Provides comprehensive annotations including:
  - Clinical significance classifications
  - Gene information
  - Molecular and functional consequences
  - Mode of inheritance if available
  - Citations and additional evidence
- **Automatic Reference Data Management**: Downloads and maintains necessary reference databases

## Installation

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SauersML/pathogenic.git
cd pathogenic

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available at target/release/pathogenic
```

## Usage

```
# Basic usage
pathogenic --build GRCh38 --input your_variants.vcf > results.csv
```

### Command-line Arguments

- `--build`, `-b`: Genome build, must be either "GRCh37" (hg19) or "GRCh38" (hg38)
- `--input`, `-i`: Path to the input VCF file (can be uncompressed or gzipped)

## Output

The tool outputs a CSV file to stdout with the following columns:

- Chromosome, Position, Reference Allele, Alternate Allele
- Clinical Significance
- Is Alt Pathogenic
- Gene
- ClinVar Allele ID
- Clinical Disease Name (CLNDN)
- Genotype
- Review Stars (0-4 star rating system)
- Allele frequencies:
  - ESP, ExAC, and 1000 Genomes Project (TGP)
  - Population-specific frequencies (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, SAS)
- Detailed annotations:
  - Molecular and Functional Consequences
  - Mode of Inheritance
  - Preferred Values
  - Citations
  - Comments and Family Data
  - Record Status
  - Description
  - Date Last Evaluated
 
Depending on available data, many of these fields may not be available.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The tool automatically downloads necessary reference databases:
   - ClinVar VCF (GRCh37 or GRCh38)
   - ClinVar summary TSV for deeper annotation
   - 1000 Genomes frequency data

2. **Variant Processing**:
   - Parses the user's VCF input
   - Filters for variants present in the sample's genotype
   - Matches variants against ClinVar to identify pathogenic variants
   - Integrates 1000 Genomes allele frequency data
   - Adds detailed annotations from ClinVar summary data

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Sorts variants by chromosome and position
   - Outputs comprehensive CSV with all annotations

## Logging

The tool maintains a log file (`pathogenic.log`) that captures all processing steps and can be useful for troubleshooting.

## Usage
Do not use this for clinical purposes.
- I might have written a bug in the code.
- Your input file might be wrong.
- Your input file may be right, but different somehow than the files I tested on.
- I did not test this extensively. In fact, there are no unit tests. (Though I did run an integration test via other tooling.)
- You might have done something wrong. For example, you entered the wrong genome build.
- The data in the database might be wrong about pathogenicity of some variant.
- You don't know how to interpret the results.
- You don't know how to interpret mode of inheritance.
- You don't know how to assess evidence for or confidence in pathogenicity.
- Your input file is imputed or has spurious genotype calls.
- Many other reasons not listed here.

What can you use this for?
- Finding potentially pathogenic variants to follow up on via other means.
